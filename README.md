# RoutingSimulator
A simulation of router communications over a network. Written in C++.

## Purpose
This project was designed with the following goals in mind:
- To understand the dynamic behavior of the distance-vector algorithm.
- To learn about programming with datagram sockets.
- To learn about socket demultiplexing and time management using the **select()** system call.

## Specifications
The project consists of a single program that is implemented on multiple, communicating 'routers,' which are emulated by processes. Each router instance will determine its local links by reading from files when the the `Run()` command is executed. 
One file, which is labled as `routers` in each `test` directory, contains a list of all the routers in the system, the hostname on which they run, and the beginning port number that they use. Each of the other files in the given `test` directory will specify the link information for each router. Those directories, labled `A.cfg`, `B.cfg`, `C.cfg`, etc, correspond to routers named `A`, `B`, `C`, etc, respectively. The predefined test cases use `localhost` for the hostname and a fixed set of port numbers. *You are free to edit this file to allow different routers to run on different hosts or to use different port numbers*.

## Running the project
Each router should be invoked like this:

`
router [-p] testdir routername
`

Where `testdir` is the name of the directory containing the configuration files and `routername` is a single-letter router name corresponding to an entry in the list of routers. The `-p` switch controls the use of poisoned-reverse.
The router initializes its routing table and distance-vector with entries for all directly-connected neighbors. Non-neighbors can either be added dynamically or entered initially with an infinite cost. *For brevity's sake, infinity is defined as 64.*

## Message Protocol
###Router update messages
Each router learns of better paths to other routers by receiving distance vector updates from its neighbors. The neighbors send distance vector update messages that look like:

`
U d1 cost1 d2 cost2 â€¦ dn costn
`

That is, the letter `U` followed by a space, followed by a single-letter destination name, followed by a space, followed by the cost of reaching the destination from the neighbor expressed as a sequence of ascii decimal digits. The di and costi fields are repeated for as many entries as the sending router has in its own distance vector.

###Link cost messages
The routers may receive link-cost changes as well. These look like:

`
L n cost
`

Where `n` is the single-letter name of a neighbor and cost is the new cost of reaching that neighbor directly (as decimal digits). Link cost messages will only be received for existing links, but the cost of a link may change to infinity and back. Upon receiving either of these messages, the router makes the appropriate changes to its own distance-vector and to its routing table, and if there are changes, it sends the changed distance-vector immediately to its neighbors using `U` messages.
